a. What is the probability that at least one of the computers is down at a particular moment, assuming that machine failures are independent? Note: This probability is 1 - Prob(all 4 computers are up).


MTBF = 480 days = 11520 hours
TTR = 120 min = 2 hours

Probability that one computer is up   		   = MTBF/(MTBF +TTR) = 11520 / 11522 = 0.9998
Probability that at least one service is down  = 1 - probability that all computers are up
											   = 1 - ((0.9998)^4)	
											   = 0.0008


b. What is the availability (probability that the service is up and running) of the replicated service, assuming that machine failures are independent? Note: The service fails only if all four computers fail simultaneously.

Probablity that one computer is down = 2/11522

Probablity that all computers are down (independently) = (2/11522)^4

P(availability of the replicated service)  = 1 - Probablity that all computers are down
										   = 1 - ((2/11522)^4)
